The CNCF Global Week of Cloud Native Sustainability is an event organized by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](http://cncf.io) community to address the emerging topic of environmental sustainability in the cloud native industry and open source space. The event aims to engage with the community and IT industry as a whole, get a better understanding of the current environmental sustainability landscape, and promote collaboration and knowledge sharing on the topic.

During the **second week of October 2023 (W41)**, the [CNCF community groups around the globe](https://community.cncf.io/chapters/) will organize meetups in their cities with a focus on cloud native sustainability. These meetups can be organized by anyone interested in supporting the effort. Additionally, the [CNCF Environmental Sustainability Technical Advisory Group (TAG ENV)](http://github.com/cncf/tag-env-sustainability), will host a virtual meetup using the [bevy](https://www.bevy.com) platform.
These meetups can be organized by anyone interested in supporting the effort. If you would like to contribute, check out the [Contact and Resources](#contact-and-resources) section below.

There will be two types of events organized during the Cloud Native Sustainability Week:

1. **Local in-person events**: Meetups organized worldwide during the second week of October 2023 by [CNCF community groups](https://community.cncf.io/chapters/) about cloud native sustainability.
2. **Virtual Event**: A virtual meetup organized by the CNCF TAG ENV.
